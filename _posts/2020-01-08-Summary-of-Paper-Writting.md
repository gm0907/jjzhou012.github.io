## 写在前面

阅读了这么多论文，对于英语不太强的我来说，有些精彩的表达方式确实值得借鉴。话不多说，抄录之☞。





## 摘要

- We **present a novel XXX architecture capable of** learning a joint representation of both local graph structure and available node features for the multi-task learning of link prediction and node classification.

## 综述

- Advances in this direction are often categorized as … (这方面的进展可以归纳为…)

- 

## 模型评价/比较

- XXX always **produces a significant boost in** predictive performance.
- XXX model **performs favorably well on the task of** …
- model1 **achieves competitive performance against** model2, and **significantly outperforms** model3.
- We **empirically compare** our models **against** four strong baselines summarized in Table, which were designed specifically for XXX task.
- This complexity is on par with the baseline methods such as …



## 实验说明
