## 写在前面

阅读了这么多论文，对于英语不太强的我来说，有些精彩的表达方式确实值得借鉴。话不多说，抄录之☞。

- 推荐工具：[http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/](http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/)
- REF-N-WRITE：[https://www.ref-n-write.com/trial/academic-phrasebank/](https://www.ref-n-write.com/trial/academic-phrasebank/)

## 摘要

- We **present a novel XXX architecture capable of** learning a joint representation of both local graph structure and available node features for the multi-task learning of link prediction and node classification.

## 综述

- Advances in this direction are often categorized as … (这方面的进展可以归纳为…)
- There has been a surge of algorithms that seek to …
- There are a limited number of existing reviews on the topic of …
- To tackle these challenges, tremendous effort has been made towards this area, resulting in a rich literature of related papers and methods. 

## 方法

- **[简化符号]** To simplify notations, we drop the subscript/superscript for the xxx, i.e. xxx.
- In order to overcome this limitation, we develop a XXX method, which is a simple yet effective approach to ...





## 模型评价/比较

- XXX always **produces a significant boost in** predictive performance.
- XXX model **performs favorably well on the task of** …
- model1 **achieves competitive performance against** model2, and **significantly outperforms** model3.
- We **empirically compare** our models **against** four strong baselines summarized in Table, which were designed specifically for XXX task.
- This complexity is on par with the baseline methods such as …



## 实验说明

- In this section, we **expound our protocol for the empirical evaluation of our models’ capability for** learning and generalization on the tasks of link prediction and semi-supervised node classification.
- **[data split]** we split the data into disjoint test, and validation, sets of 1,000, and 500, examples, respectively.
- **[data split]** Each dataset is separated into a training, testing set and validation set. The validation set contains 5% citation edges for hyperparameter optimization, the test set holds 10% citation edges to verify the performance, and the rest are used for training.
- In comparison to the baselines, we evaluate our model on the same data splits over 10 runs with XXX and report mean AUC/AP scores for link prediction and accuracy scores for node classification.
- **[parameter]** varying parameter XX from … to …

### 图表

- **[描述框架]** We introduce XXX, schematically depicted in Figure 1, capable of … for XXX task.
  - **We introduce** the Multi-Task Graph Autoencoder (MTGAE) architecture, **schematically depicted in Figure 1, capable of** learning a shared representation of latent node embeddings from local graph topology and available explicit node features **for** LPNC. 
- [图标题]
  - Schematic depiction of XXX architecture.
  - Illustration of the proposed XXX
  - Illustration of applying XXX



## 工作的创新点

- our work ……, **whereas previous related methods** ……
- We provide **a comprehensive empirical evaluation of our models on** nine benchmark graph-structured datasets **and demonstrate significant improvement over related methods** for graph representation learning.
